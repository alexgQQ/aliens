# Intelligent Aliens Game

## What?

The idea behind this is to tinker with some Tensorflow, Keras and Pygame to implement a [Deep Q Learning model](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2019/04/introduction-deep-q-learning-python/). These models are good for understanding a set of undefined rules based on an action/reward feedback loop based on a current state.

Run the game to see the Marine shoot at the Alien while it learns to doge the bullets more effectivley.
